            <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
            <p class="last-updated">Last updated: September 22, 2025</p>

            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how AiHome (“we”, “us”, or “our”) handles information when you use the AiHome mobile application (the “App” or the “Service”).</p>
            <p>AiHome is designed to help you redesign and visualize interiors, apply styles, replace furniture, recolor walls and floors, and export design results. We prioritize your privacy and handle your images and design inputs responsibly.</p>

            <h2>Key Points</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>No account is required to use AiHome.</li>
                <li>We do not use in-app advertising or third-party analytics by default.</li>
                <li>Images and design inputs you choose to process may be transmitted to our backend services to generate results. Exports are initiated solely by you.</li>
                <li>Notifications, if any, are used solely for optional guidance or tips you enable.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Information We Handle</h2>
            <h3>Photos and Design Inputs You Provide</h3>
            <p>The App allows you to upload or select photos of interiors and provide design preferences. These are used to generate visual results, style suggestions, and previews.</p>

            <h3>Permissions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Photos:</strong> Access to your photo library is required to select images for design processing.</li>
                <li><strong>Camera (optional):</strong> If you capture new photos from within the App.</li>
                <li><strong>Notifications (optional):</strong> If you enable guidance or tips.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Export and Sharing</h3>
            <p>You may choose to export your design results (e.g., files or share options) to send them to collaborators or professionals. Exports are initiated solely by you. After export, the handling of that copy is your responsibility.</p>

            <h2>What We Do Not Collect</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>We do not collect personally identifiable information (such as name, email, address) unless you directly contact us.</li>
                <li>We do not use third‑party advertising SDKs or analytics SDKs by default.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Use of Information</h2>
            <p>Images and inputs are used to provide core features such as visual redesign results, previews, suggestions, and exports. If you contact us for support and share information with us, we will use it only to respond to your inquiry.</p>

            <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
            <p>Your images may be transmitted to backend services to generate results and may be cached on your device for performance. Please protect your device with a passcode and keep your operating system updated. If you delete the App or your device data, locally cached results may be lost unless you export or back them up.</p>

            <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is not directed to children under 13. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with personal information, please contact us and we will address it promptly.</p>

            <h2>International Use</h2>
            <p>Your use of the App may be subject to privacy and health data regulations in your region. We do not transfer your health data to our servers. If you choose to export data, that exported copy may be processed by services of your choice according to their terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
            <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Material changes will be reflected by updating the “Last updated” date above and publishing the updated policy in the App resources or website.</p>

                <p>When We disclose personal information for a business purpose or a commercial purpose, We enter a contract that describes the purpose and requires the recipient to both keep that personal information confidential and not use it for any purpose except performing the contract.</p>

This means that We may have received some kind of benefit in return for sharing personal information, but not necessarily a monetary benefit.</p>

                <h3>Sale of Personal Information of Minors Under 16 Years of Age</h3>
                <p>We do not knowingly collect personal information from minors under the age of 16 through our Service, although certain third party websites that we link to may do so. These third-party websites have their own terms of use and privacy policies and we encourage parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and instruct their children to never provide information on other websites without their permission.</p>
                <p>We do not sell the personal information of Consumers We actually know are less than 16 years of age, unless We receive affirmative authorization (the "right to opt-in") from either the Consumer who is between 13 and 16 years of age, or the parent or guardian of a Consumer less than 13 years of age. Consumers who opt-in to the sale of personal information may opt-out of future sales at any time. To exercise the right to opt-out, You (or Your authorized representative) may submit a request to Us by contacting Us.</p>
                <p>If You have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 (or 16) has provided Us with personal information, please contact Us with sufficient detail to enable Us to delete that information.</p>

                <p>Only You, or a person registered with the California Secretary of State that You authorize to act on Your behalf, may make a verifiable request related to Your personal information.</p>
                <p>Your request to Us must:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Provide sufficient information that allows Us to reasonably verify You are the person about whom We collected personal information or an authorized representative</li>
                <li>Describe Your request with sufficient detail that allows Us to properly understand, evaluate, and respond to it</li>
                </ul>
                <p>We cannot respond to Your request or provide You with the required information if We cannot:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Verify Your identity or authority to make the request</li>
                <li>And confirm that the personal information relates to You</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Our Service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from anyone under the age of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We have collected Personal Data from anyone under the age of 13 without verification of parental consent, We take steps to remove that information from Our servers.</p>
                <p>If We need to rely on consent as a legal basis for processing Your information and Your country requires consent from a parent, We may require Your parent's consent before We collect and use that information.</p>
                
                <h2>Links to Other Websites</h2>
