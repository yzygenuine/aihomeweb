            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>By downloading, installing, or using the AiHome mobile application ("Service"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you disagree with any part of these terms, then you may not access the Service.</p>

            <h2>Description of Service</h2>
            <p>AiHome helps users redesign and visualize interiors, apply styles, replace or rearrange furniture, recolor walls and floors, and export design results. The App does not provide architectural, engineering, or safety certifications.</p>

            <h2>Important Disclaimer</h2>
            <div class="important-notice">
                <h3>⚠️ Visualization Only</h3>
                <p>AiHome is intended for creative visualization and design exploration. It is not a professional architectural or engineering tool and does not guarantee structural, safety, or compliance outcomes. Always consult qualified professionals before making construction or safety-related decisions.</p>

            <p>Your privacy is important to us. Please review our <a href="privacy_policy.html">Privacy Policy</a>, which explains how the App handles information. In short: your design inputs and images are handled according to the policy and may be processed by backend services to generate results.</p>

            <h2>Intellectual Property</h2>
            <p>The Service and its original content, features, and functionality are and will remain the exclusive property of the PulseBP owner and its licensors. The Service is protected by copyright, trademark, and other laws. Our trademarks may not be used without prior written consent.</p>

            <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App may link to or allow you to interact with third-party services (for example, email or file apps you use to export data). Those services are governed by their own terms and privacy policies.</p>

            <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
            <p>The Service is provided on an "as is" and "as available" basis without warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement. We do not warrant that the Service will be uninterrupted or error-free.</p>

            <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
            <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, in no event shall the PulseBP owner, nor its directors, employees, partners, agents, suppliers, or affiliates, be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including without limitation, loss of profits, data, use, goodwill, or other intangible losses, resulting from or relating to your use of the Service.</p>

            <h2>Indemnification</h2>
            <p>You agree to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the PulseBP owner and its licensees, licensors, employees, contractors, agents, officers, and directors from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney's fees) arising from your use of the Service or violation of these Terms.</p>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            <p>We may terminate or suspend your access to the Service immediately, without prior notice or liability, for any reason whatsoever, including without limitation if you breach these Terms. Upon termination, your right to use the Service will cease immediately.</p>

            <h2>App Store Terms</h2>

            <h2>Changes to Terms</h2>
            <p>We may modify or replace these Terms at any time by updating the "Last updated" date above and publishing the updated Terms in the App resources or website.</p>

            <h2>Severability</h2>
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
